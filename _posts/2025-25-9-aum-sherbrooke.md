## Internship in Sherbrooke

In this post, I will talk about my internship in Shebrooke , in particular I will explain my macro and micro AUM (Area Under the Minimum) functions , which are an extension to the multi class problem of the AUM loss function( see https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v24/21-0751.html) . The AUM loss function was built to optimized the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic curves) AUC (Area Under the Curve). 

## TODO
While I get to finish this blog , see this notebook I made : [AUM_multiclass_notebooke.ipynb](https://github.com/OGuenoun/AUMMulticlass/blob/main/AUM_multiclass_notebook.ipynb)
